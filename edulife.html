        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">With an ever increasing competitive cloud storage
          platform market, a new competitor with innovative
          features still offers the potential for advantageous competition in the marketplace.
          How can I prove a new way for students to organize their personal and academic files without the
          added stress of user directed organization?

        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">edulife, a cloud platform built for students, allows users, to organize, upload, create, and share their content
          while keeping personal and academic files organized separately, maintaining a true work-life balance.

<p>#1 pain point: current cloud storage application make it difficult to  organize files, folders, and photos.

75% cite uploading files and file organization as the most important features when using storage apps.

<p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">
  "To build a usable, minimum viable product, I conducted a
  competative analysis of three leading competitors in the
  cloud/online storage platform market: GoogleDrive, DropBox, and Pinterest. With that in mind,
  the cloud storage platform to be created needed to be geared towards
  a busy people-students who enjoy balancing hobbies outside academia. What if there was a cloud
  storage platform that preorganized files and folders for its users to minimize the frustration of self cloud
  organization?"

<h3 class="cs-head">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="projectsectionlabel">
</div>
<h2 class="cs-section-head">THE FINAL PROTOTYPE: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>
<p>To meet web accessibiliity guidelines, significant changes in color (specifically the ivory and violet on the onboarding and homepages were eliminated and replaced with a royal blue, which, as it turned out, further meets one of the core values of the edulife brand: sophistictaion. While call to action buttons were aligned in the same column in lo-fi mock ups, they did not create a sense of unity for users among both color scheme, proximity, and visual hierarchy. To create a friendly user interface with navigable functions, all call to action buttons were enlarged with added coloring. Specifically, the user dashboard now presents a navigable page for the user to perform actions such as “Upload” or “Create.”  Seconly, onboarding pages did promote log in or sign up proccesses to users by having the menu on the left hand side of the page. The call to action buttons “Sign in here” and “Join edulife” did not stand out to users as actions; during user testing, they were overlooked when attempting to log in or sign up for an account and users expressed difficulty in performing the task.

<img class="personal folder" src="images/menu-Personal Folder.png" alt="final menu folder">

<h3 class="cs-head1">FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
<p>In its current state, edulife is a minimally viable procuct. If the project were to be continued I would
implement the following:

- Conduct more user tests: to test the functionality of call to action buttons and web accessibility colors

- As mentioned in the previous section, the one of biggest challenges was maintaining consistency across UI elements and establishing patterns for user interaction and animations in the early stages in the design process. Making a list of how elements would interact with one another when conducting user tests would have served me better prior to prototyping

-Design all app processes early in the design process!

- Design a process for users to upload folders, I had users only test uploading files

- Offer sign up and create account options in the same page! Making two separate pages created confusion points for users when testing.


-Seek feedback constantly and aggressively, two user tests during lo-fi mock ups and two during hi-fi mockups did not suffice. I would have benefitted from testing up to four people while conducting multiple tests throughout the design process. Testing each process, each flow, each design decision, will help build the backbone of an efficient, visually appealing, usable product.
