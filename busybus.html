       <h2>The Problem</h2>
       <h4>Transit officials have identified a problem they would like to solve. Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be the bus the rider is expecting.
        Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.</h4>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <h4>As a result of an analysis of two competitors within the market (Google Maps & Moovit), I came up with interesting ideas on how a new competitor, in this case, BusyBus, could enter the saturated market.</h4>
      </section>
      <p>Google Maps was the leading app that my user participants used for planning their trips. They offered public transit data that offered directions both in and out of metropolitan areas, giving users the ability to download maps for offline use. However, they lacked in providing real time public transit information and walking navigation directions can sometimes be inaccurate.
</p>
<p>Moovit, a community-driven app hence, gives its users access to real time transit data but is limited for those who need driving directions or public transit information in suburbs where transit options are limited. The app doesnâ€™t allow their users to manually update their route while in progress.</p>

<p>For BusyBus to compete in the saturated market, the app must include features and strengths of major compeitors witihn the industury that conjure a user centric approach by incorporating <b>real time updates</b> and <b>alerts</b>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h4>The MVP, BusyBus addresses the main problem set out to solve within the public transit system, a usable, navigable iOS application to assist bus riders at Washington & State. Users are able to easily view the location of the next arriving bus thatâ€™s within their vicinity on their screen. Bus locations are also properly labeled with their line number so users are never confused as to which direction their bus is coming from. Hierarchy is applied to easily see which bus line arrives in a set amount of time with active bus lines in blue, rerouted buses in red with out of service buses in grey.
              Users have access to seeing all lines arriving at the bus stop of their choice after selecting the bus stop nearest to them. For added ease of navigation and use, a navigation bar below allows the user to access their account, ask for help, and search for bus lines/stops.</h4>
